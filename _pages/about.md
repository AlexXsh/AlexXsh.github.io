Welcome to my personal website!

My name ***Shenghao Xia***. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arizona (UA) majoring in ***Statistics & Data Science***, minoring in ***Systems & Industrial Engineering***. I also hold two M.S. degrees in Statistics and Industrial Engineering from UA. And I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from UA.

**About my Ph.D. research**

My current research interest is in ***interpretable knowledge-informed statistical modeling*** based on statistical machine learning (ML)/ artificial intelligence (AI) to solve real-world challenges involving ***high-dimensional and spatial-temporal data***. My research emphasizes enhancing the effectiveness of complex engineering systems monitoring, by integrating statistics, operation research, ML/AI, computational science, and domain-specific knowledge.
